## Hello!
My name is Aleksandra Nikiforova. I am currently a student at the Apple Developer Academy in Naples, Italy. I'm starting my journey in developing applications in the Swift language.

## Values
I value constant development and love for what you do, which is why I am now enjoying learning SwiftUI. I started learning from scratch in September 2022, and now I continue to improve my skills in creating a user-friendly product with a focus on creative idea and intuitive interface.

You'll find my personal projects, open-source contributions, and experiments on my GitHub profile.
