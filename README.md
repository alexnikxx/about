## Hello ðŸ¦•
Iâ€™m Sasha, an iOS-developer. My professional journey began in Octoberâ€™22 at the Apple Developer Academy in Naples, where I was introduced to the brave new world of app development. Iâ€™m currently looking for a new role where I can grow, refine my skills, and continue to improve.

## Values
I believe a good developer brings everything people need into one place, freeing them from the endless search for a better experience by creating something simple and intuitive. Thatâ€™s the kind of professional I aspire to be. People are the greatest strength in this world, and I look forward to making new connections so we can inspire and support each other to create amazing things.

Here you'll find my personal projects, open-source contributions, and experiments so feel free to look around and connect!
